Android app to send location information to a Nikon camera.

This app uses the Android Location Provider to acquire periodical location updates. 
It will construct NMEA sentences out of these and then send those sentences to a paired 
bluetooth serial port.

Supporting hardware receives these sentences and then offer them to a Nikon D7000 camera.

The ongoing description of this project is at [this page](http://rurandom.org/justintime/index.php?title=Sending_location_information_from_an_Android_phone_to_a_Nikon_camera).
